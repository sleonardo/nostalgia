Project Nostalgia
===============

This project reimagines the Pokémon Emerald introduction scene as arcade style iOS game. All artwork is ripped directly from the Pokémon Emerald ROM and is thus unable to be published on the App Store.

# Introduction
The game gives you control as the legendary Pokémon Latios or Latias. You soar through the skies as MewTwo telekinetically creates boulder rings for you to go through, awarding you points as you fly through them. See how long you can last!

# Features
* Artwork is ripped and modified from the original ROM of Pokémon Emerald
* Working Game UI
* Infinitely and randomly generated ring boulder obstacles
* Fine-tuned flight mechanics
* Updating score counter
* Very realistic collision mechanics
* SpriteKit framework usage

# Future Ideas and Implementations
* An intro cinematic before every round where MewTwo is seen creating boulder rings for Latios/Latias
* A PokéWorld multiplayer hub which allows trainers to train their Latios/Latias by continuously playing
* Working Levelling/XP system for Latios/Latias after each round is complete
